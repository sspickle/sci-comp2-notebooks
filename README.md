# Scientific Computing II (PHYS-310)

This is a collection of notebooks to support PHYS-310.

We will roughly cover 4-5 topics:

1. Hyperbolic PDEs (wave equations)
2. Parabolic PDEs (heat/diffusion equations)
3. Complex PDEs (Shrodinger Eq.)
4. Monte Carlo methods (random numbers and all that)
5. Finite Element Methods (intro to sfepy)
